"""End-to-end annotation moderation over two real clients against the in-process
server (moderation ON by default -- the `server` fixture builds create_app with
no MODERATION_OFF).

Two guarantees are proven on the wire, not in the geometry (the concrete
swastika inputs are the detector's own fixtures): a drawer who paints a full
swastika never lands the complete symbol on the receiver -- neither in one
snapshot (the receiver only ever sees the server's cleaned corrective, empty
arrows) nor drawn incrementally delta-by-delta (the realistic attack: the
completing delta is never relayed and the corrective snapshot wipes the leaked
partials, so the receiver's reconstructed view never once contains every
segment and ends empty) -- while the drawer alone gets `annotations_blocked`;
and the hide-opponent-marks shield (carried at matchmake time, flipped
mid-game with `set_marks_visibility`) stops relay to the hider entirely,
notifies the sender exactly once per share session (the second attempt is an
absence assertion, not a wait), and -- on un-hide -- pushes the accumulated
store the hider missed.
