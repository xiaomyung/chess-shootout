"""Desync detection + /resume recovery.

Invariant under test: a client detects a dropped/out-of-order broadcast by
comparing the server's `ply` field against `len(move_history)`, fires
request_state_sync, and gates every further move_applied/takeback behind the
`_resyncing` flag until _handle_game_resumed clears it.
