"""The authoritative server skill-check state machine, driven through the real
handlers with a fake clock and recording websockets. This is the security core:
the move gate (pending/locked guards before any mutation), the one-shot-latch shot
handler (server-owned miss_count, deadline re-check), WIN/FAIL resolution, terminal
hygiene (resign/flag clear pending, takeback blocked, ping no-resync), the
single-resolver sweep deadline, the server-secret selection, and the resume payload.

The geometry seed is server-generated per check, so winning/failing tests READ the
stored pending.seed and solve for an elapsed the pure engine scores — they never
guess the seed (mirrors how the server itself adjudicates).
