"""Idle-window choreography through the real dispatch choke point, plus the
offer-response handlers' outcome vocabulary.

Every allowlisted message runs _touch_idle_window AFTER its handler, so the
handler's arm/disarm (a landed ply) and finalize (a resign) are what the touch
re-validates against. Two guards carry the whole policy: only the RESIGNATION
window ever resets on activity, and only the side on the hook can reset it.

handle_draw_response and handle_takeback_response answer with a short outcome
word that leaves the server only through the dispatch DEBUG line -- nothing else
in the suite reads them, so the words themselves and the ORDER of the guards that
pick them are pinned here. The order is load-bearing in one place: a takeback
response is refused while a skill check is held BEFORE the frame is parsed, while
a draw response has no pending guard at all and parses first.
