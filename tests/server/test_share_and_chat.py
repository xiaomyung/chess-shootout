"""Shared annotations + quick chat: the server relay, rate limiters, move-wipe,
and /resume payload, driven end-to-end through real websockets with a fake clock.

Every relaying handler mutates its store synchronously and only then awaits the
opponent send; there is exactly one await per handler (the relay). A finalize
racing in between the mutate and the send is therefore harmless -- the store is
already coherent and a stray relay to a just-finished room is dropped by the
receiving client. That single-await discipline is why the tests can assert store
state immediately after a send without worrying about interleaving.

Sender-received-nothing is proved with a ping sentinel: after a relay/noop, the
mover pings and the very next frame it reads back must be the pong, so a stray
echo would have surfaced ahead of it.
