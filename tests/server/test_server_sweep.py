"""Sweep step methods exercised in isolation via a fake clock.

The Sweep class wraps the per-tick lifecycle: each step does one thing
(skill-check deadlines, clock + idle windows, heartbeat timeout, grace
expiry, pre-game orphan drop, abandoned/timed-out queue reaping,
post-game rematch window, finished-room GC) so we drive each
independently without the full asyncio loop.
